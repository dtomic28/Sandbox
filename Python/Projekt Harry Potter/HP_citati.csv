1;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.
2;Minerva McGonagall;Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.
3;Minerva McGonagall;Are the rumors true, Albus?
4;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I'm afraid so, professor.
5;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;The good and the bad.
6;Minerva McGonagall;And the boy?
7;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Hagrid is bringing him.
8;Minerva McGonagall;Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
9;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
10;Rubeus Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore, sir.
11;Rubeus Hagrid;Professor McGonagall.
12;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
13;Rubeus Hagrid;No, sir.
14;Rubeus Hagrid;Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol.
15;Rubeus Hagrid;Try not to wake him.
16;Rubeus Hagrid;There you go.
17;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?
18;Minerva McGonagall;I've watched them all day.
19;Minerva McGonagall;They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.
20;Minerva McGonagall;They really are...
21;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;The only family he has.
22;Minerva McGonagall;This boy will be famous.
23;Minerva McGonagall;There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
24;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Exactly.
25;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;He's far better off growing up away from all of that.
26;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Until he's ready.
27;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;There, there, Hagrid.
28;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;It's not really goodbye, after all.
29;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Good luck...Harry Potter.
30;Petunia Dursley;Up. Get up!
31;Petunia Dursley;Now!
32;Dudley Dursley;Wake up, cousin!
33;Dudley Dursley;We're going to the zoo!
34;Petunia Dursley;Here he comes, the birthday boy.
35;Vernon Dursley;Happy birthday, son.
36;Petunia Dursley;Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
37;Harry James Potter;Yes, Aunt Petunia.
38;Petunia Dursley;I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day!
39;Vernon Dursley;Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
40;Harry James Potter;Yes, Uncle Vernon.
41;Petunia Dursley;Aren't they wonderful, darling?
42;Dudley Dursley;How many are there?
43;Vernon Dursley;36. Counted them myself.
44;Dudley Dursley;36?! But last year... last year I had 37!
45;Vernon Dursley;But some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year's.
46;Dudley Dursley;I don't care how big they are!
47;Petunia Dursley;Oh, now, now, now. 
48;Petunia Dursley;This is what we're going to do...
49;Petunia Dursley;is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents.
50;Petunia Dursley;How's that, pumpkin?
51;Petunia Dursley;It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
52;Petunia Dursley;I'm really looking forward to it.
53;Vernon Dursley;I'm warning you now, boy.
54;Vernon Dursley;Any funny business, any at all...
55;Vernon Dursley;And you won't have any meals for a week.
56;Vernon Dursley;Get in.
57;Dudley Dursley;Make it move.
58;Vernon Dursley;Move!
59;Dudley Dursley;Move!
60;Harry James Potter;He's asleep!
61;Dudley Dursley;He's boring.
62;Harry James Potter;Sorry about him.
63;Harry James Potter;He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day...
64;Harry James Potter;...watching people press their ugly faces in on you.
65;Harry James Potter;Can you hear me?
66;Harry James Potter;It's just, I've never talked to a snake before.
67;Harry James Potter;Do you...?
68;Harry James Potter;I mean, do you talk to people often?
69;Harry James Potter;You're from Burma, aren't you?
70;Harry James Potter;Was it nice there?
71;Harry James Potter;Do you miss your family?
72;Harry James Potter;I see. That's me as well.
73;Harry James Potter;I never knew my parents either.
74;Harry James Potter;Mummy, Dad, come here! 
75;Dudley Dursley;you won't believe what this snake is doing!
76;Snake;Thanks.
77;Harry James Potter;Anytime.
78;Someone;Snake!
79;Dudley Dursley;Mum! Mummy! Help me!
80;Petunia Dursley;My darling boy!
81;Petunia Dursley;How did you get in there?
82;Petunia Dursley;Who did this?
83;Petunia Dursley;How did you get in there?
84;Petunia Dursley;ls there a snake?
85;Petunia Dursley;It's all right, sweetheart.
86;Petunia Dursley;We'll get you out of these cold clothes.
87;Vernon Dursley;What happened?
88;Harry James Potter;I swear, I don't know!
89;Harry James Potter;One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic.
90;Vernon Dursley;There's no such thing as magic.
91;Petunia Dursley;And smile!
92;Petunia Dursley;Vernon, just look at him!
93;Petunia Dursley;I can't believe it!
94;Petunia Dursley;In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.
95;Vernon Dursley;Caveat Smeltonia.
96;Vernon Dursley;Proudest moment of my life.
97;Harry James Potter;Will I have to wear that too?
98;Petunia Dursley;What? You? Go to Smeltings?
99;Petunia Dursley;Don't be so stupid!
100;Petunia Dursley;You're going to go to the state school.
101;Petunia Dursley;Where you belong.
102;Petunia Dursley;This is what you'll going to be wearing, when I finish dyeing it.
103;Harry James Potter;That's Dudley's old uniform.
104;Harry James Potter;It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
105;Petunia Dursley;It'll fit you well enough.
106;Petunia Dursley;Go get the post. Go!
107;Vernon Dursley;Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
108;Dudley Dursley;Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
109;Harry James Potter;Hey, give it back! It's mine!
110;Vernon Dursley;Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
111;Vernon Dursley;No more mail through this letterbox.
112;Petunia Dursley;Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
113;Vernon Dursley;Shoo! Go on.
114;Vernon Dursley;Fine day, Sunday.
115;Vernon Dursley;In my opinion, best day of the week.
116;Vernon Dursley;Why is that, Dudley?
117;Harry James Potter;Because there's no post on Sundays?
118;Vernon Dursley;Right you are, Harry!
119;Vernon Dursley;No post on Sunday.
120;Vernon Dursley;No blasted letters today! No, sir.
121;Vernon Dursley;Not one single bloody letter. Not one!
122;Vernon Dursley;No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...
123;Dudley Dursley;Stop it!
124;Dudley Dursley;Mummy, what's happening?
125;Vernon Dursley;Give me that!
126;Vernon Dursley;Give me that letter!
127;Harry James Potter;Get off!
128;Harry James Potter;They're my letters!
129;Harry James Potter;Let go of me!
130;Vernon Dursley;That's it!
131;Vernon Dursley;We're going away!
132;Vernon Dursley;Far away, where they can't find us!
133;Dudley Dursley;Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
134;Harry James Potter;Make a wish, Harry.
135;Vernon Dursley;Who's there?
136;Rubeus Hagrid;Sorry about that.
137;Vernon Dursley;I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
138;Vernon Dursley;You are breaking and entering!
139;Rubeus Hagrid;Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.
140;Rubeus Hagrid;Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry.
141;Rubeus Hagrid;But you're a bit more along than I would have expected.
142;Rubeus Hagrid;Particularly 'round the middle.
143;Dudley Dursley;I'm not Harry.
144;Harry James Potter;I am.
145;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, of course you are.
146;Rubeus Hagrid;Got something for you.
147;Rubeus Hagrid;Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.
148;Rubeus Hagrid;Baked it myself, words and all.
149;Harry James Potter;Thank you.
150;Rubeus Hagrid;It's not every day that your young man turns 11, now is it?
151;Harry James Potter;Excuse me, who are you?
152;Rubeus Hagrid;Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.
153;Rubeus Hagrid;Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
154;Harry James Potter;Sorry, no.
155;Rubeus Hagrid;No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
156;Harry James Potter;Learnt what?
157;Rubeus Hagrid;You're a wizard, Harry.
158;Harry James Potter;I'm a what?
159;Rubeus Hagrid;A wizard.
160;Rubeus Hagrid;And a thumping good one, I'd wager, once you're trained up little.
161;Harry James Potter;No, you've made a mistake.
162;Harry James Potter;I mean...l can't be a wizard.
163;Harry James Potter;I mean, I'm just Harry.
164;Harry James Potter;Just Harry.
165;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen?
166;Rubeus Hagrid;Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared?
167;Harry James Potter;Dear Mr. Potter,
168;Harry James Potter;"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
169;Vernon Dursley;He will not be going there!
170;Vernon Dursley;We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.
171;Harry James Potter;You knew? 
172;Harry James Potter;You knew all along and you never told me?
173;Petunia Dursley;Of course we knew.
174;Petunia Dursley;How could you not be?
175;Petunia Dursley;My perfect sister being who she was.
176;Petunia Dursley;My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter.
177;Petunia Dursley;We have a witch in the family.
178;Petunia Dursley;"Isn't it wonderful?"""
179;Petunia Dursley;I was the only one to see her for what she was.
180;Petunia Dursley;A freak!
181;Petunia Dursley;Then she met that Potter, and then she had you...
182;Petunia Dursley;and I knew you would be the same.
183;Petunia Dursley;Just as strange, just as abnormal.
184;Petunia Dursley;And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up!
185;Petunia Dursley;And we got landed with you.
186;Harry James Potter;Blown up?
187;Harry James Potter;You told me my parents died in a car crash.
188;Rubeus Hagrid;A car crash? 
189;Rubeus Hagrid;A car crash killed Lily and James Potter?
190;Petunia Dursley;We had to say something.
191;Rubeus Hagrid;It's an outrage!
192;Rubeus Hagrid;It's a scandal!
193;Vernon Dursley;He'll not be going.
194;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
195;Harry James Potter;Muggle?
196;Rubeus Hagrid;Non-magic folk.
197;Rubeus Hagrid;This boy's had his name down ever since he were born.
198;Rubeus Hagrid;He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...
199;Rubeus Hagrid;he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.
200;Vernon Dursley;I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks.
201;Rubeus Hagrid;Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.
202;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that.
203;Rubeus Hagrid;Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
204;Harry James Potter;Okay.
205;Rubeus Hagrid;Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
206;Rubeus Hagrid;Best be off.
207;Rubeus Hagrid;Unless you'd rather stay, of course.
208;Harry James Potter;First year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand.
209;Rubeus Hagrid;Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
210;Harry James Potter;One pair of dragon hide gloves.
211;Harry James Potter;Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?
212;Rubeus Hagrid;They don't mean a penguin, do they?
213;Rubeus Hagrid;Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
214;Harry James Potter;You'd like a dragon?
215;Rubeus Hagrid;Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
216;Rubeus Hagrid;Vastly misunderstood.
217;Harry James Potter;"All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
218;Harry James Potter;Can we find all this in London?
219;Rubeus Hagrid;If you know where to go.
220;Barkeep Tom;Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
221;Rubeus Hagrid;No, thanks, Tom.
222;Rubeus Hagrid;I'm on official Hogwarts business.
223;Rubeus Hagrid;Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
224;Barkeep Tom;Bless my soul.
225;Barkeep Tom;It's Harry Potter!
226;Man;Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
227;Man;Welcome back.
228;Witch;Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
229;Witch;I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
230;Quirinus Quirrell;Harry Potter. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
231;Rubeus Hagrid;Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.
232;Rubeus Hagrid;Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. 
233;Rubeus Hagrid;He will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts
234;Harry James Potter;Oh, nice to meet you.
235;Quirinus Quirrell;Fearfully fascinating subject.
236;Quirinus Quirrell;Not that you need it, eh, Potter?
237;Rubeus Hagrid;Yes, well, must be going now.
238;Rubeus Hagrid;Lots to buy.
239;Harry James Potter;Goodbye.
240;Rubeus Hagrid;See, Harry? You're famous.
241;Harry James Potter;But why am I famous, Hagrid?
242;Harry James Potter;All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
243;Rubeus Hagrid;I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person to tell you that, Harry.
244;Rubeus Hagrid;Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.
245;Rubeus Hagrid;Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.
246;Rubeus Hagrid;And over there, all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
247;Boy;It's a world-class racing broom.
248;Boy;Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!
249;Boy;It's the fastest model yet.
250;Harry James Potter;But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
251;Harry James Potter;I haven't any money.
252;Rubeus Hagrid;Well there's your money, Harry.
253;Rubeus Hagrid;Gringotts, the wizard bank.
254;Rubeus Hagrid;Ain't no safer place, not one.
255;Rubeus Hagrid;Except perhaps Hogwarts.
256;Harry James Potter;Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
257;Rubeus Hagrid;They're goblins, Harry.
258;Rubeus Hagrid;Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.
259;Rubeus Hagrid;Best stay close.
260;Rubeus Hagrid;Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
261;Goblin;And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
262;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, Wait a minute.
263;Rubeus Hagrid;Got it here somewhere.
264;Rubeus Hagrid;Ha! Here's the little devil.
265;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, and there's something else as well.
266;Rubeus Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore gave me this.
267;Rubeus Hagrid;It's about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which.
268;Goblin;Very well.
269;Griphook;Vault 687.
270;Griphook;Lamp, please.
271;Griphook;Key, please.
272;Rubeus Hagrid;Didn't think your mum and dad will leave you with nothing, now did ya?
273;Griphook;Vault 713.
274;Harry James Potter;What's in there, Hagrid?
275;Rubeus Hagrid;Can't tell you, Harry.
276;Rubeus Hagrid;Hogwarts business. Very secret.
277;Griphook;Stand back.
278;Rubeus Hagrid;Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.
279;Harry James Potter;I still need... a wand.
280;Rubeus Hagrid;A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
281;Rubeus Hagrid;There ain't no place better.
282;Rubeus Hagrid;Why don't you run along there and wait.
283;Rubeus Hagrid; I just got one more thing I gotta do.
284;Rubeus Hagrid; Won't be long.
285;Harry James Potter;Hello?
286;Harry James Potter;Hello?
287;Garrick Ollivander;I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.
288;Garrick Ollivander;It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.
289;Garrick Ollivander;Here we are.
290;Garrick Ollivander;Give it a wave.
291;Garrick Ollivander;Apparently not.
292;Garrick Ollivander;Perhaps… this
293;Garrick Ollivander;No, no, definitely not.
294;Garrick Ollivander;No matter.
295;Garrick Ollivander;I wonder.. Curious.
296;Garrick Ollivander;Very curious.
297;Harry James Potter;Sorry, but what's curious?
298;Garrick Ollivander;I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.
299;Garrick Ollivander;It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather.
300;Garrick Ollivander;Just one other.
301;Garrick Ollivander;It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. 
302;Harry James Potter;And who owned that wand?
303;Garrick Ollivander;We do not speak his name.
304;Garrick Ollivander;The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
305;Garrick Ollivander;It's not always clear why.
306;Garrick Ollivander;But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you.
307;Garrick Ollivander;After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things.
308;Garrick Ollivander;Terrible yes, but great
309;Rubeus Hagrid;Harry! Harry!
310;Rubeus Hagrid;Happy birthday.
311;Rubeus Hagrid;You all right, Harry?
312;Rubeus Hagrid;You seem very quiet.
313;Harry James Potter;He killed my parents, didn't he?
314;Harry James Potter;The one who gave me this.
315;Harry James Potter;You know, Hagrid. 
316;Harry James Potter;I know you do.
317;Rubeus Hagrid;First, and understand this Harry because it's very important:
318;Rubeus Hagrid;Not all wizards are good.
319;Rubeus Hagrid;Some of them go bad.
320;Rubeus Hagrid;A few years ago there was a one wizard who went as bad as he can go.
321;Rubeus Hagrid; His name was V...
322;Rubeus Hagrid;His name was V...
323;Harry James Potter;Maybe if you wrote it down?
324;Rubeus Hagrid;No, I can't spell it.
325;Rubeus Hagrid;All right, Voldemort.
326;Harry James Potter;Voldemort?
327;Rubeus Hagrid;It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.
328;Rubeus Hagrid;Voldemort started to gather some followers.
329;Rubeus Hagrid;Brought them over to the Dark Side.
330;Rubeus Hagrid;Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.
331;Rubeus Hagrid;Your parents fought against him.
332;Rubeus Hagrid;But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.
333;Rubeus Hagrid;Nobody, not one.
334;Rubeus Hagrid;Except you.
335;Harry James Potter;Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
336;Rubeus Hagrid;Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry.
337;Rubeus Hagrid;A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.
338;Harry James Potter;What happened to V...?
339;Harry James Potter;To You-Know-Who?
340;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, some say he died.
341;Rubeus Hagrid;Codswallop, in my opinion.
342;Rubeus Hagrid;Nope, I reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on.
343;Rubeus Hagrid;But one thing's absolutely certain. 
344;Rubeus Hagrid;Something about you stumped him that night.
345;Rubeus Hagrid;That's why you're famous.
346;Rubeus Hagrid;That's why everybody knows your name.
347;Rubeus Hagrid;You're the boy who lived.
348;Rubeus Hagrid;What are you looking at?
349;Rubeus Hagrid;Blimey, is that the time?
350;Rubeus Hagrid;Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
351;Rubeus Hagrid;Dumbledore will be wanting his...
352;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
353;Rubeus Hagrid;Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.
354;Rubeus Hagrid;Here's your ticket. 
355;Rubeus Hagrid;Stick to it, Harry that's very important. 
356;Rubeus Hagrid;Stick to your ticket.
357;Harry James Potter;Platform 9 3/4?
358;Harry James Potter;But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
359;Harry James Potter;This says platform 9 3/4.
360;Harry James Potter;There's no such thing, is there?
361;Man;Sorry.
362;Harry James Potter;Excuse me. Excuse me.
363;Trainmaster;Right on your left Madam.
364;Harry James Potter;Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?
365;Trainmaster;9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?
366;Molly Weasley;It's the same every year, packed with Muggles, Of course. 
367;Molly Weasley;Come on!
368;Harry James Potter;Muggles?
369;Molly Weasley;Platform 9 3/4, this way.
370;Molly Weasley;All right, Percy, you first.
371;Molly Weasley;Fred, you next.
372;George Weasley;He's not Fred, I am.
373;Fred Weasley;Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?
374;Molly Weasley;Oh, I'm sorry, George.
375;Fred Weasley;I'm only joking. I am Fred.
376;Harry James Potter;Excuse me.
377;Harry James Potter;Could you tell me how to...?
378;Molly Weasley;How to get onto the platform?
379;Molly Weasley;Not to worry, dear.
380;Molly Weasley;It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.
381;Molly Weasley;All you've got do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10.
382;Molly Weasley;Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
383;Ginevra (Ginny) Molly Weasley;Good luck.
384;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Excuse me. Do you mind?
385;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Everywhere else is full.
386;Harry James Potter;No. Not at all.
387;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I'm Ron, by the way.
388;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ron Weasley.
389;Harry James Potter;I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
390;Ronald Bilius Weasley;So it's true!
391;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I mean, do you really have the...?
392;Harry James Potter;The what?
393;Ronald Bilius Weasley;The scar?
394;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wicked!
395;Woman;Anything off the trolley, dears?
396;Ronald Bilius Weasley;No, thanks. I'm all set.
397;Harry James Potter;We'll take the lot.
398;Harry James Potter;Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
399;Ronald Bilius Weasley;They mean every flavor.
400;Ronald Bilius Weasley;There's chocolate and peppermint and there's also spinach, liver and tripe.
401;Ronald Bilius Weasley;George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
402;Harry James Potter;These aren't real frogs, are they?
403;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's just a spell.
404;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Besides, It's the cards you want.
405;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.
406;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I've got about 500 myself.
407;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Watch it!
408;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Oh, that's rotten luck.
409;Ronald Bilius Weasley;They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
410;Harry James Potter;I've got Dumbledore!
411;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I got about six of him.
412;Harry James Potter;Hey, he's gone!
413;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
414;Ronald Bilius Weasley;This is Scabbers, by the way.
415;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Pathetic, isn't he?
416;Harry James Potter;Just a little bit.
417;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow.
418;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Want to see?
419;Harry James Potter;Yeah.
420;Hermione Jean Granger;Has anyone seen a toad?
421;Hermione Jean Granger;A boy named Neville's lost one
422;Ronald Bilius Weasley;No.
423;Hermione Jean Granger;Oh, are you doing magic?
424;Hermione Jean Granger;Let's see, then.
425;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.
426;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.
427;Hermione Jean Granger;Are you sure that's a real spell?
428;Hermione Jean Granger;Well, it's not very good, is it?
429;Hermione Jean Granger;Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me.
430;Hermione Jean Granger;For example:
431;Hermione Jean Granger;Oculus Reparo.
432;Hermione Jean Granger;That's better, isn't it?
433;Hermione Jean Granger;Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!
434;Hermione Jean Granger;I'm Hermione Granger.
435;Hermione Jean Granger;And you are...?
436;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I'm Ron Weasley.
437;Hermione Jean Granger;Pleasure.
438;Hermione Jean Granger;You two better change into robes.
439;Hermione Jean Granger;I expect we'll be arriving soon.
440;Hermione Jean Granger;You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
441;Hermione Jean Granger;Did you know?
442;Hermione Jean Granger;Just there.
443;Rubeus Hagrid;Right, then.
444;Rubeus Hagrid;First years, this way, please!
445;Rubeus Hagrid;Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
446;Rubeus Hagrid;Come on now, hurry up.
447;Rubeus Hagrid;Hello, Harry.
448;Harry James Potter;Hey, Hagrid.
449;Rubeus Hagrid;Right, then. This way to the boats.
450;Rubeus Hagrid;Come on, now, follow me.
451;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wicked.
452;Minerva McGonagall;Welcome to Hogwarts.
453;Minerva McGonagall;Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates.
454;Minerva McGonagall;But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses.
455;Minerva McGonagall;They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
456;Minerva McGonagall;Now, while you're here, your house will be like your family.
457;Minerva McGonagall;Your triumphs will earn you points.
458;Minerva McGonagall;Any rule-breaking, and you will lose points.
459;Minerva McGonagall;At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup
460;Neville Longbottom;Trevor! Sorry.
461;Minerva McGonagall;The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.
462;Draco Malfoy;It's true then, what they're saying on the train.
463;Draco Malfoy;Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
464;Whispers;Harry Potter?
465;Draco Malfoy;This is Crabbe, and Goyle.
466;Draco Malfoy;And I'm Malfoy.
467;Draco Malfoy;Draco Malfoy.
468;Draco Malfoy;Think my name's funny, do you?
469;Draco Malfoy;I've no need to ask yours.
470;Draco Malfoy;Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
471;Draco Malfoy;You must be a Weasley.
472;Draco Malfoy;We'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter.
473;Draco Malfoy;You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
474;Draco Malfoy;I can help you there.
475;Harry James Potter;I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
476;Minerva McGonagall;We're ready for you now.
477;Minerva McGonagall;Follow me.
478;Hermione Jean Granger;It's not real, the ceiling. 
479;Hermione Jean Granger;It's just bewitched to look like the night sky.
480;Hermione Jean Granger;I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
481;Minerva McGonagall;All right, will you wait along here, please?
482;Minerva McGonagall;Now, before we begin Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
483;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.
484;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students.
485;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.
486;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Thank you.
487;Minerva McGonagall;When I call your name, you will come forth.
488;Minerva McGonagall;I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head and you will be sorted into your houses.
489;Minerva McGonagall;Hermione Granger.
490;Hermione Jean Granger;Oh, no. Okay, relax.
491;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Mental, that one, I'm telling you.
492;Sorting Hat;Ah, right then... hmm... right.
493;Sorting Hat;Okay. Gryffindor!
494;Minerva McGonagall;Draco Malfoy.
495;Sorting Hat;Slytherin!
496;Ronald Bilius Weasley;There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
497;Minerva McGonagall;Susan Bones.
498;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry, what is it?
499;Harry James Potter;Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
500;Sorting Hat;Let's see I know! Hufflepuff!
501;Minerva McGonagall;Ronald Weasley.
502;Sorting Hat;Another Weasley!
503;Sorting Hat;I know just what to do with you.
504;Sorting Hat;Gryffindor!
505;Minerva McGonagall;Harry Potter.
506;Sorting Hat;Hmm... difficult, very difficult.
507;Sorting Hat;Plenty of courage, I see.
508;Sorting Hat;Not a bad mind, either.
509;Sorting Hat;There's talent, oh, yes.
510;Sorting Hat;And a thirst to prove yourself.
511;Sorting Hat;But where to put you?
512;Harry James Potter;Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
513;Sorting Hat;Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?
514;Sorting Hat;You could be great, you know.
515;Sorting Hat;It's all here, in your head.
516;Sorting Hat;And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatnesses, no doubt about that.
517;Sorting Hat;No? Well, if you're sure.
518;Sorting Hat;Better be...Gryffindor!
519;Minerva McGonagall;Your attention, please.
520;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Let the feast begin.
521;Seamus Finnigan;I'm half and half.
522;Seamus Finnigan;My dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.
523;Seamus Finnigan;Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
524;Harry James Potter;Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
525;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Oh, thats Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
526;Harry James Potter;What's he teach?
527;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Potions.
528;Percy Ignatius Weasley;But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
529;Percy Ignatius Weasley;He's been after Quirrell's job for years.
530;Sir Nicholas;Hello! How are you?
531;Sir Nicholas;Welcome to Gryffindor.
532;Girl;Look, It's the Bloody Baron!
533;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Hello, Sir Nicholas.
534;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Have a nice summer?
535;Sir Nicholas;Dismal. Once again, my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied.
536;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I know you.
537;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You're Nearly Headless Nick.
538;Sir Nicholas;I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind.
539;Hermione Jean Granger;Nearly headless?
540;Hermione Jean Granger;How can you be nearly headless?
541;Sir Nicholas;Like this.
542;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindors, follow me please.
543;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Keep up. Thank you.
544;Boy;Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
545;Percy Ignatius Weasley;This is the most direct path to the dormitories.
546;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
547;Percy Ignatius Weasley;They like to change.
548;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Keep up, please, and follow me.
549;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Quickly now, come on. Come on.
550;Neville Longbottom;That picture's moving.
551;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Look at that one.
552;Harry James Potter;I think she fancies you.
553;Girl;Oh, look! Look!
554;Girl;Who's that girl?
555;Man in paint;Welcome to Hogwarts.
556;Fat Lady;Password?
557;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Caput Draconis.
558;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
559;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Quickly, come on.
560;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gather around here.
561;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.
562;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
563;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Girls, the same on your right.
564;Percy Ignatius Weasley;You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
565;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Made it!
566;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?
567;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That was bloody brilliant!
568;Minerva McGonagall;Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.
569;Minerva McGonagall;Perhaps, lt'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch.
570;Minerva McGonagall;That way, one of you might be on time.
571;Harry James Potter;We got lost.
572;Minerva McGonagall;Then perhaps a map?
573;Minerva McGonagall;I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
574;Severus Snape;There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class.
575;Severus Snape;As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making.
576;Severus Snape;However, for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses.
577;Severus Snape;I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death.
578;Severus Snape;Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention.
579;Severus Snape;Mr. Potter.
580;Severus Snape;Our new celebrity.
581;Severus Snape;Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
582;Severus Snape;You don't know? Well, let's try again.
583;Severus Snape;Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?
584;Harry James Potter;I don't know, Sir.
585;Severus Snape;And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
586;Harry James Potter;I don't know, Sir.
587;Severus Snape;Pity.
588;Severus Snape;Clearly, fame isn't everything is it, Mr. Potter?
589;Harry James Potter;Clearly, Hermione knows.
590;Harry James Potter;Seems a pity not to ask her.
591;Severus Snape;Silence.
592;Severus Snape;Put your hand down, you silly girl!
593;Severus Snape;For your information, Potter
594;Severus Snape;Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.
595;Severus Snape;A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
596;Severus Snape;As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.
597;Severus Snape;Well...
598;Severus Snape;Why aren't you all copying this down?
599;Severus Snape;And Gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek.
600;Seamus Finnigan;Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
601;Seamus Finnigan;Turn this water into rum.
602;Seamus Finnigan;Eye of rabbit...
603;Harry James Potter;What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
604;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Turn it into rum. 
605;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...
606;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Mail's here.
607;Harry James Potter;Can I borrow this? Thanks.
608;Dean;Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall
609;Hermione Jean Granger;I've read about those.
610;Hermione Jean Granger;When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something.
611;Neville Longbottom;The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
612;Harry James Potter;Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
613;Harry James Potter;Listen.
614;Harry James Potter;"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken."
615;Harry James Potter;"The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."""
616;Harry James Potter;That's odd. 
617;Harry James Potter;That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
618;Madam Hooch;Good afternoon, class.
619;Class;Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
620;Madam Hooch;Good afternoon, Amanda.
621;Madam Hooch;Good afternoon.
622;Madam Hooch;Welcome to your first flying lesson.
623;Madam Hooch;Well, what are you waiting for? 
624;Madam Hooch;Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick.
625;Madam Hooch;Come on now, hurry up. 
626;Madam Hooch;"Stick your right hand over the broom and say, ""Up."""
627;Class;Up!
628;Draco Malfoy;Up.
629;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Up. Up!
630;Madam Hooch;With feeling.
631;Hermione Jean Granger;Up. Up. Up!
632;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Shut up, Harry.
633;Madam Hooch;Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it.
634;Madam Hooch;And grip it tight, you don't wanna be sliding off the end.
635;Madam Hooch;When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard.
636;Madam Hooch;Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment
637;Madam Hooch;Then lean forward slightly and touch back down.
638;Madam Hooch;On my whistle. Three, two...
639;Madam Hooch;Mr. Longbottom.
640;Madam Hooch;Mr. Longbottom!
641;Neville Longbottom;Down, down!
642;Class;Neville!
643;Madam Hooch;Come back down this instant!
644;Madam Hooch;Everyone out of the way!
645;Girl;Is he all right?
646;Madam Hooch;Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
647;Madam Hooch;Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.
648;Madam Hooch;Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.
649;Madam Hooch;Understand? If I see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.
650;Draco Malfoy;Did you see his face?
651;Draco Malfoy;Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.
652;Harry James Potter;Give it here, Malfoy.
653;Draco Malfoy;No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.
654;Draco Malfoy;How about on the roof?
655;Draco Malfoy;What's the matter, Potter?
656;Draco Malfoy;Bit beyond your reach?
657;Hermione Jean Granger;Harry, no way!
658;Hermione Jean Granger;You heard what Madam Hooch said.
659;Hermione Jean Granger;Besides, you don't even know how to fly.
660;Hermione Jean Granger;What an idiot.
661;Harry James Potter;Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!
662;Draco Malfoy;Is that so?
663;Draco Malfoy;Have it your way, then.
664;Boy;Nice going, Harry.
665;Boy;That was wicked, Harry!
666;Minerva McGonagall;Harry Potter!
667;Minerva McGonagall;Follow me.
668;Minerva McGonagall;You wait here.
669;Minerva McGonagall;Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
670;Minerva McGonagall;Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?
671;Quirinus Quirrell;Oh, yes, of course.
672;Minerva McGonagall;Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
673;Minerva McGonagall;Wood, I have found you a Seeker.
674;Sir Nicholas;Have you heard? 
675;Sir Nicholas;Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. 
676;Sir Nicholas;I always knew hed do well.
677;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Seeker? 
678;Ronald Bilius Weasley;But first years never make their house teams! 
679;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
680;Harry James Potter;A century, according to McGonagall.
681;Fred Weasley;Hey, well done, Harry, 
682;Fred Weasley;Wood's just told us!
683;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Fred and George are on the team, too. 
684;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Beaters.
685;George Weasley;Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. 
686;George Weasley;Can't make any promises, of course. 
687;George Weasley;Rough game, Quidditch.
688;Fred Weasley;Brutal. 
689;Fred Weasley;But no one's died in years. 
690;Fred Weasley;Someone will vanish occasionally  
691;George Weasley;But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
692;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Oh, go on, Harry, 
693;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Quidditch is great. 
694;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Best game there is! 
695;Ronald Bilius Weasley;And you'll be great, too!
696;Harry James Potter;But I've never even played Quidditch. 
697;Harry James Potter;What if I make a fool of myself?
698;Hermione Jean Granger;You won't make a fool of yourself. 
699;Hermione Jean Granger;It's in your blood.
700;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Whoa. 
701;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
702;Harry James Potter;I-I didn't know.
703;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I'm telling you, it's spooky. 
704;Ronald Bilius Weasley;She knows more about you than you do.
705;Harry James Potter;Who doesn't?
706;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ahh!
707;Harry James Potter;What's happening?
708;Hermione Jean Granger;The staircases change, remember?
709;Harry James Potter;Let's go this way.
710;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Before the staircase moves again. 
711;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
712;Hermione Jean Granger;We're not supposed to be here. 
713;Hermione Jean Granger;This is the 3rd floor. 
714;Hermione Jean Granger;It's forbidden.
715;Harry James Potter;Let's go.
716;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's Filch's cat!
717;Harry James Potter;Run! Quick, let's hide through that door!
718;Harry James Potter;It's locked!
719;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's it, we're done for!
720;Hermione Jean Granger;Oh, move over! 
721;Hermione Jean Granger;Alohomora
722;Hermione Jean Granger;Get in
723;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Alohomora?
724;Hermione Jean Granger;Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
725;Argus Filch;Anyone here, my sweet? Come on.
726;Hermione Jean Granger;Filch is gone.
727;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Probably thinks this door's locked.
728;Hermione Jean Granger; It was locked.
729;Harry James Potter;And for good reason. 
730;All  ;AHHHHHHH! 
731;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What do they think they're doing?? 
732;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
733;Hermione Jean Granger; You don't use your eyes, do you? 
734;Hermione Jean Granger;Didn't you see what it was standing on?
735;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I wasn't looking at its feet! 
736;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. 
737;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
738;Hermione Jean Granger;It was standing on a trap door. 
739;Hermione Jean Granger;Which means it wasn't there by accident. 
740;Hermione Jean Granger;It's guarding something.
741;Harry James Potter;Guarding something?
742;Hermione Jean Granger;That's right. 
743;Hermione Jean Granger;Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled!
744;Ronald Bilius Weasley;She needs to sort out her priorities!
745;Oliver ;Quidditch is easy enough to understand. 
746;Oliver ;Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. 
747;Oliver ;There are three kinds of balls. 
748;Oliver ;This one's called the Quaffle.
749;Oliver ;Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. 
750;Oliver ;The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. 
751;Oliver ;With me so far?
752;Harry James Potter;I think so. 
753;Harry James Potter;What are those?
754;Oliver  ;You better take this. 
755;Oliver  ;Careful now, it's comin' back. 
756;Oliver  ;Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. 
757;Harry James Potter;What was that?
758;Oliver  ;Bludger. Nasty little buggers. 
759;Oliver  ;But you are a Seeker.
760;Oliver  ;The only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. 
761;Harry James Potter;I like this ball.
762;Oliver ;Ah, you like it now. 
763;Oliver ;Just wait. 
764;Oliver ;It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
765;Harry James Potter;What do I do with it?
766;Oliver  ;You catch it...before the other team's seeker. 
767;Oliver  ;You catch this, the game is over. 
768;Oliver  ;You catch this, Potter, and we win.
769;Harry James Potter;Whoa.
770;Filius Flitwick;One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. 
771;Filius Flitwick;Uh, do you all have your feathers? Good. 
772;Filius Flitwick;Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? 
773;Filius Flitwick;The swish and flick. Everyone. 
774;Class;The swish and flick. 
775;Filius Flitwick;Good. 
776;Filius Flitwick;And enunciate. 
777;Filius Flitwick;Wingardium Leviosa. 
778;Filius Flitwick;Off you go then.
779;Draco Malfoy;Wingardium Levio-saaa.
780;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wingardrium Leviosar. 
781;Hermione Jean Granger;Stop, stop, stop.
782;Hermione Jean Granger;You're going to take someone's eye out. 
783;Hermione Jean Granger;Besides, youre saying it wrong. 
784;Hermione Jean Granger;It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.
785;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You do it then if you're so clever. 
786;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Go on, go on.
787;Hermione Jean Granger;Wingardium Leviosa.
788;Filius Flitwick;Oh, well done! 
789;Filius Flitwick;See here, everyone! 
790;Filius Flitwick;Ms. Granger's done it! 
791;Filius Flitwick;Oh, splendid!
792;Seamus Finnigan;Wingard Levosa. Wingardly Lev... 
793;Filius Flitwick;Whooaaa! Ooh.
794;Harry James Potter;I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
795;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. 
796;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Honestly, she's a nightmare. 
797;Ronald Bilius Weasley;No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
798;Harry James Potter;I think she heard you.
799;Harry James Potter;Where's Hermione?
800;Neville Longbottom;Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. 
801;Neville Longbottom;She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
802;Quirinus Quirrell;TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! 
803;Quirinus Quirrell;T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! 
804;Quirinus Quirrell;Thought you ought to know. 
805;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!
806;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore; Everyone will please, not panic. 
807;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. 
808;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
809;Girl  ;Hufflepuff, this way!
810;Boy  ;Stay together!
811;Percy Ignatius Weasley;Gryffindors...keep up please. 
812;Percy Ignatius Weasley;And stay alert!
813;Harry James Potter;How could a troll get in?
814;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Not by itself. 
815;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Trolls are really stupid. 
816;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Probably people playing jokes.
817;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What?
818;Harry James Potter;Hermione! 
819;Harry James Potter;She doesn't know!
820;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I think the troll's left the dungeon.
821;Harry James Potter;It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
822;Harry James Potter;Hermione, move!
823;Hermione Jean Granger;Help! Help!
824;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Hey, pea brain! 
825;Hermione Jean Granger;Ahhh! Help!
826;Harry James Potter;Whooa! Whoa, whoa! 
827;Harry James Potter;Do something!
828;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What?
829;Harry James Potter;Anything! 
830;Harry James Potter;Hurry up!
831;Hermione Jean Granger;Swish and flick!
832;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wingardium Leviosa! 
833;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Cool!
834;Hermione Jean Granger;Is it...dead?
835;Harry James Potter;I don't think so. 
836;Harry James Potter;Just knocked out. 
837;Harry James Potter; Ew. Troll bogies.
838;Minerva McGonagall;Oh! Oh, my goodness! 
839;Minerva McGonagall;E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
840;Ron and Harry;Well, what it is...
841;Hermione Jean Granger;It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. 
842;Minerva McGonagall; Ms. Granger?
843;Hermione Jean Granger;I went looking for the troll. 
844;Hermione Jean Granger;I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. 
845;Hermione Jean Granger;But I was wrong. 
846;Hermione Jean Granger;If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...
847;Hermione Jean Granger;I'd probably be dead.
848;Minerva McGonagall;Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. 
849;Minerva McGonagall;I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and I am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger. 
850;Minerva McGonagall;5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. 
851;Minerva McGonagall;As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. 
852;Minerva McGonagall;Not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 
853;Minerva McGonagall;5 points...will be awarded to each of you. 
854;Minerva McGonagall;For sheer dumb luck. 
855;Quirinus Quirrell;Perhaps you ought to go...
856;Quirinus Quirrell;M-might wake up...heh.Ahh! Hehe....
857;Harry James Potter;Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
858;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Mind you, we did save her life.
859;Harry James Potter;Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.
860;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What are friends for?
861;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
862;Hermione Jean Granger;Ron's right, Harry. 
863;Hermione Jean Granger;You're gonna need your strength today.
864;Harry James Potter;I'm not hungry.
865;Severus Snape;Good luck today, Potter. 
866;Severus Snape;Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.
867;Harry James Potter;That explains the blood.
868;Hermione Jean Granger;Blood?
869;Harry James Potter;Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. 
870;Harry James Potter;But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
871;Hermione Jean Granger; But why would anyone go near that dog?
872;Harry James Potter;The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults.
873;Harry James Potter; He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
874;Hermione Jean Granger;So you're saying...
875;Harry James Potter;That's what the dog's guarding. 
876;Harry James Potter;That's what Snape wants.
877;Hermione Jean Granger;Bit early for mail, isn't it?
878;Harry James Potter;But I-I never get mail.
879;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Let's open it.
880;Harry James Potter;It's a broomstick!
881;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Thats not just a broomstick, Harry. 
882;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's a Nimbus 2000!
883;Harry James Potter;But who...?
884;OIiver  ;Scared, Harry?
885;Harry James Potter;A little.
886;Oliver  ;That's all right. 
887;Oliver  ;I felt the same way before my first game.
888;Harry James Potter;What happened?
889;Oliver  ;Er, I don't really remember. 
890;Oliver  ;I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. 
891;Oliver  ;Woke up in the hospital a week later.
892;Lee Jordan;Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! 
893;Lee Jordan;Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
894;Lee Jordan;The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
895;Madam Hooch;Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. 
896;Lee Jordan;The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. 
897;Lee Jordan;Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. 
898;Lee Jordan;The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
899;Lee Jordan;The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
900;Lee Jordan;Angelina Johnson scores! 
901;Lee Jordan;10 points for Gryffindor! 
902;Harry James Potter;Yes! Whoa!
903;Rubeus Hagrid;Well done!
904;Lee Jordan;Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
905;Lee Jordan;Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
906;Harry James Potter;Yes!
907;Lee Jordan; Another 10 points to Gryffindor! 
908;Gryffindors  ;Yay!
909;Marcus Flint;Give me that! 
910;Crowd  ;Boooo!!
911;Marcus Flint;Take that side!
912;Harry James Potter;Whoa! Whooa!
913;Rubeus Hagrid;What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
914;Hermione Jean Granger;It's Snape! 
915;Hermione Jean Granger;He's jinxing the broom!
916;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Jinxing the broom? 
917;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What do we do?
918;Hermione Jean Granger;Leave it to me. 
919;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Come on, Hermione!
920;Hermione Jean Granger;Lacarnum Inflamarae.
921;Man  ;Fire! You're on fire!
922;Severus Snape;What? Oh!
923;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Go!
924;Rubeus Hagrid;Go go go!
925;Rubeus Hagrid;Looks like he's gonna be sick.
926;Lee Jordan;He's got the Snitch! 
927;Lee Jordan;Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
928;Madam Hooch ;Gryffindor win!
929;All  ;YAY!
930;Draco Malfoy;No!
931;Rubeus Hagrid;Yes!
932;Hermione Jean Granger;Whoo-hoo!
933;Crowd  ;Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! 
934;Rubeus Hagrid;Nonsense. 
935;Rubeus Hagrid;Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
936;Harry James Potter;Who knows. 
937;Harry James Potter;Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
938;Rubeus Hagrid;Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
939;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Fluffy?
940;Hermione Jean Granger;That thing has a name?
941;Rubeus Hagrid; Well, of course he's got a name. 
942;Rubeus Hagrid;He's mine. 
943;Rubeus Hagrid;I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. 
944;Rubeus Hagrid;Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
945;Harry James Potter;Yes?
946;Rubeus Hagrid;Shouldn'ta said that.  No more questions!
947;Rubeus Hagrid;Don't ask any more questions. 
948;Rubeus Hagrid;That's top secret, that is.
949;Harry James Potter;But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!
950;Rubeus Hagrid;Codswallop. 
951;Rubeus Hagrid;Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
952;Hermione Jean Granger;Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. 
953;Hermione Jean Granger;I've read all about them. 
954;Hermione Jean Granger;You have to keep eye contact. 
955;Hermione Jean Granger;And Snape wasn't blinking.
956;Harry James Potter;Exactly.
957;Rubeus Hagrid;Now, you listen to me, all three of you. 
958;Rubeus Hagrid;You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. 
959;Rubeus Hagrid;It's dangerous.
960;Rubeus Hagrid;What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
961;Harry James Potter;Nicholas Flamel?
962;Rubeus Hagrid;I shouldn't have said that. 
963;Rubeus Hagrid;I should not have said that. 
964;Rubeus Hagrid;I should not have said that. 
965;Harry James Potter;Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
966;Hermione Jean Granger;I don't know.
967;Harry James Potter;Knight to E-5.
968;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Queen to E-5.
969;Hermione Jean Granger;That's totally barbaric!
970;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's wizard's chess. 
971;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I see you've packed.
972;Hermione Jean Granger;See you haven't.
973;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Change of plans. 
974;Ronald Bilius Weasley;My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. 
975;Ronald Bilius Weasley;He's studying dragons there!
976;Hermione Jean Granger;Good. You can help Harry, then. 
977;Hermione Jean Granger;He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
978;Ronald Bilius Weasley;We've looked a hundred times!
979;Hermione Jean Granger;Not in the restricted section...
980;Hermione Jean Granger;Happy Christmas.
981;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I think we've had a bad influence on her.
982;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry, wake up! 
983;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Come on Harry, wake up!
984;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Happy Christmas, Harry.
985;Harry James Potter;Happy Christmas, Ron. 
986;Harry James Potter;What are you wearing?
987;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Oh, Mum made it. 
988;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Looks like you've got one too!
989;Harry James Potter;I've got presents?
990;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Yeah!
991;Harry James Potter;Oh! 
992;Ronald Bilius Weasley;There they are. 
993;Harry James Potter;Your father left this in my possession before he died.
994;Harry James Potter;It is time it was returned to you.
995;Harry James Potter;Use it well.
996;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What is it?
997;Harry James Potter;Some kind of...cloak.
998;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Well, let's see then. 
999;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Put it on.
1000;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Whoa!
1001;Harry James Potter;My body's gone!
1002;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I know what that is! 
1003;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's an invisibility cloak!
1004;Harry James Potter;I'm invisible??
1005;Ronald Bilius Weasley;They're really rare. 
1006;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I wonder who gave it to you.
1007;Harry James Potter;There was no name. 
1008;Harry James Potter;"It just said, ""Use it well."""
1009;Harry James Potter;Famous fire eaters...
1010;Harry James Potter;15th Century Fiends...Flamel...
1011;Harry James Potter;Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
1012;Man  ;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
1013;Argus Filch;Who's there?! 
1014;Argus Filch;I know you're in there. 
1015;Argus Filch;You can't hide. 
1016;Argus Filch;Who is it? 
1017;Argus Filch;Show yourself!
1018;Quirinus Quirrell;Severus...I-I thought...
1019;Severus Snape;You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
1020;Quirinus Quirrell; W-what do you m-mean?
1021;Severus Snape;You know perfectly well what I mean. 
1022;Severus Snape;We'll have another chat soon...
1023;Severus Snape;When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
1024;Argus Filch;Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. 
1025;Argus Filch;It's still hot. 
1026;Argus Filch;That means there's a student out of bed.
1027;Harry James Potter;Mum? Dad? 
1028;Harry James Potter;Ron! You've really got to see this! 
1029;Harry James Potter;Ron! You've got to see this! 
1030;Harry James Potter;Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
1031;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Why?
1032;Harry James Potter;There's something you've got to see. 
1033;Harry James Potter;Now, come on!
1034;Harry James Potter;Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
1035;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I only see us.
1036;Harry James Potter;Look in properly. Go on. 
1037;Harry James Potter;Stand there. There. 
1038;Harry James Potter;You see them, don't you? 
1039;Harry James Potter;Thats my dad
1040;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and 
1041;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I'm holding the Quidditch cup! 
1042;Ronald Bilius Weasley;And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! 
1043;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I look good. 
1044;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
1045;Harry James Potter;How can it? 
1046;Harry James Potter;Both my parents are dead.
1047;George Weasley;Do you like yours, Ron?
1048;George Weasley;Ron?
1049;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I'll be right back.
1050;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wanna play chess?
1051;Harry James Potter;No.
1052;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
1053;Harry James Potter;No.
1054;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't.
1055;Ronald Bilius Weasley;There's something not right about that mirror.
1056;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Back again, Harry?
1057;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. 
1058;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I trust by now you realize what it does. 
1059;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Let me give you a clue. 
1060;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
1061;Harry James Potter;So, then it shows us what we want? 
1062;Harry James Potter;Whatever we want?
1063;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Yes...and no. 
1064;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. 
1065;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. 
1066;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;But remember this, Harry. 
1067;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. 
1068;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. 
1069;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again.
1070;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.
1071;Hermione Jean Granger;Look at you, playing with your cards.
1072;Hermione Jean Granger;Pathetic!
1073;Hermione Jean Granger;We've got final exams coming up soon.
1074;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I'm ready. Ask me any question.
1075;Hermione Jean Granger;Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
1076;Ronald Bilius Weasley;I forgot.
1077;Hermione Jean Granger;And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
1078;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Copy off you.
1079;Hermione Jean Granger;No, you won't.
1080;Hermione Jean Granger;Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an Anti Cheating Spell.
1081;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's insulting! 
1082;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again!
1083;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Leg-Locker Curse?
1084;Harry James Potter;Malfoy.
1085;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.
1086;Neville Longbottom;How? I can barely stand at all!
1087;Seamus Finnigan;I'll do the countercurse!
1088;Neville Longbottom;No, that's all I need!
1089;Neville Longbottom;You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!
1090;Seamus Finnigan;I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom.
1091;Seamus Finnigan;Besides, if anyone cared to notice my eyebrows have completely grown back!
1092;Harry James Potter;I found him!
1093;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.
1094;Harry James Potter;Go on!
1095;Ronald Bilius Weasley;For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicholas Flamel!
1096;Harry James Potter;I knew the name sound familiar.
1097;Harry James Potter;I read it on the train that day.
1098;Hermione Jean Granger;Follow me!
1099;Neville Longbottom;Hey! Wait! Where are you going?
1100;Neville Longbottom;What about the countercurse?
1101;Hermione Jean Granger;I had you looking in the wrong section! 
1102;Hermione Jean Granger;How could I be so stupid? 
1103;Hermione Jean Granger;I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
1104;Ronald Bilius Weasley;This is light?
1105;Hermione Jean Granger;Of course! Here it is! 
1106;Hermione Jean Granger;Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!
1107;Ron and Harry  ;The what?
1108;Hermione Jean Granger;Honestly, don't you two read? 
1109;Hermione Jean Granger;"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. "
1110;Hermione Jean Granger;It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
1111;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Immortal?
1112;Hermione Jean Granger;It means you'll never die.
1113;Ronald Bilius Weasley; I know what it means!
1114;Harry James Potter; Shh!
1115;Hermione Jean Granger;The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!
1116;Hermione Jean Granger;That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. 
1117;Hermione Jean Granger;That's what's under the trapdoor...
1118;Hermione Jean Granger;the Philosopher's Stone!
1119;Harry James Potter;Hagrid!
1120;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. 
1121;All 3  ;We know about the Sorcerer's Stone!
1122;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh.
1123;Harry James Potter;We think Snape's trying to steal it.
1124;Rubeus Hagrid;Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
1125;Harry James Potter;Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. 
1126;Harry James Potter;We just don't know why.
1127;Rubeus Hagrid;Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! 
1128;Rubeus Hagrid;He's not about to steal it!
1129;Harry James Potter;What?
1130;Rubeus Hagrid;You heard. Right. 
1131;Rubeus Hagrid;Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
1132;Harry James Potter;Wait a minute.
1133;Harry James Potter;One of the teachers?
1134;Hermione Jean Granger;Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?
1135;Hermione Jean Granger;Spells and enchantments.
1136;Rubeus Hagrid;That's right. 
1137;Rubeus Hagrid;Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
1138;Rubeus Hagrid;Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. 
1139;Rubeus Hagrid;Hehe, not a soul knows how. 
1140;Rubeus Hagrid;Except for me and Dumbledore. 
1141;Rubeus Hagrid;I shouldn't have told you that. 
1142;Rubeus Hagrid;I shouldn't have told you that. 
1143;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! 
1144;Harry James Potter;Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
1145;Rubeus Hagrid;That? It's a ... its um...
1146;Ronald Bilius Weasley; I know what that is! 
1147;Ronald Bilius Weasley;But Hagrid, how did you get one?
1148;Rubeus Hagrid;I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. 
1149;Rubeus Hagrid;Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.
1150;Hermione Jean Granger;Is that...a dragon?
1151;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's not just a dragon. 
1152;Ronald Bilius Weasley;That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! 
1153;Ronald Bilius Weasley;My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
1154;Rubeus Hagrid;Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. 
1155;Rubeus Hagrid;He knows his mummy. Hehe. 
1156;Rubeus Hagrid;Hallo, Norbert.
1157;Harry James Potter;Norbert?
1158;Rubeus Hagrid;Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?
1159;Rubeus Hagrid;Don't you, Norbert? Dededede.
1160;Rubeus Hagrid;Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...
1161;Rubeus Hagrid;He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. 
1162;Rubeus Hagrid;Who's that?
1163;Harry James Potter;Malfoy.
1164;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, dear.
1165;Harry James Potter;Hagrid always wanted a dragon. 
1166;Harry James Potter;He told me so the first time I met him.
1167;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's crazy. 
1168;Ronald Bilius Weasley;And worse, Malfoy knows.
1169;Harry James Potter;I don't understand. 
1170;Hermione Jean Granger;Is that bad?
1171;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's bad.
1172;Minerva McGonagall;Good evening.
1173;Minerva McGonagall;Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. 
1174;Minerva McGonagall;Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
1175;Harry James Potter;50?!
1176;Minerva McGonagall;Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
1177;Draco Malfoy;Excuse me, Professor. 
1178;Draco Malfoy;Perhaps I heard you wrong. 
1179;Draco Malfoy;"I thought you said...""the four of us."""
1180;Minerva McGonagall;No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. 
1181;Minerva McGonagall;You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. 
1182;Minerva McGonagall;You will join your classmates in detention.
1183;Argus Filch;A pity they let the old punishments die. 
1184;Argus Filch;There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. 
1185;Argus Filch;God, I miss the screaming. 
1186;Argus Filch;You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight.
1187;Argus Filch;He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.
1188;Argus Filch;A sorry lot this, Hagrid. 
1189;Argus Filch;Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
1190;Rubeus Hagrid;Norbert's gone.
1191;Rubeus Hagrid;Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
1192;Hermione Jean Granger;Well, that's good, isn't it? 
1193;Hermione Jean Granger;He'll be with his own kind.
1194;Rubeus Hagrid;Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? 
1195;Rubeus Hagrid;What if the other dragons are mean to him?
1196;Rubeus Hagrid;He's only a baby, after all.
1197;Argus Filch;Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. 
1198;Argus Filch;You're going into the forest, after all. 
1199;Argus Filch;Got to have your wits about you.
1200;Draco Malfoy;The forest? I thought that was a joke! 
1201;Draco Malfoy;We can't go in there. 
1202;Draco Malfoy;Students aren't allowed.
1203;Draco Malfoy; And there are...werewolves!
1204;Argus Filch; There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. 
1205;Argus Filch;You can be sure of that.
1206;Argus Filch;Nighty-night.
1207;Rubeus Hagrid;Right. Let's go.
1208;Harry James Potter; Hagrid, what's that?
1209;Rubeus Hagrid;What we're here for. 
1210;Rubeus Hagrid;See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. 
1211;Rubeus Hagrid;I found one dead a few weeks ago. 
1212;Rubeus Hagrid;Now, this one's been injured bad by something. 
1213;Rubeus Hagrid;So, it's our job to find the poor beast. 
1214;Rubeus Hagrid;Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
1215;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Okay.
1216;Rubeus Hagrid;And Harry you'll go with Malfoy. 
1217;Draco Malfoy;Okay. Then I get Fang!
1218;Rubeus Hagrid;Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. }
1219;Draco Malfoy;You wait till my father hears about this. 
1220;Draco Malfoy;This is servant's stuff.
1221;Harry James Potter;If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
1222;Draco Malfoy;Scared, Potter?! 
1223;Draco Malfoy;Did you hear that? 
1224;Draco Malfoy;Come on, Fang.  Scared.
1225;Harry James Potter;What is it, Fang?
1226;Draco Malfoy;AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! HELP!!!!!
1227;Firenze  ;Harry Potter, you must leave. 
1228;Firenze  ;You are known to many creatures here. 
1229;Firenze  ;The forest is not safe at this time. 
1230;Firenze  ;Especially for you.
1231;Harry James Potter;But what was that thing you saved me from?
1232;Firenze ;A monstrous creature. 
1233;Firenze ;It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. 
1234;Firenze ;Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. 
1235;Firenze ;But at a terrible price. 
1236;Firenze ;You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. 
1237;Firenze ;A cursed life.
1238;Harry James Potter;But who would choose such a life?
1239;Firenze  ;Can you think of no one?
1240;Harry James Potter; Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...
1241;Harry James Potter;that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
1242;Firenze  ;Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
1243;Harry James Potter;The Sorcerer's Stone.
1244;Hermione Jean Granger;Harry!
1245;Rubeus Hagrid;Hello there, Firenze. 
1246;Rubeus Hagrid;I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. 
1247;Rubeus Hagrid;You all right there, Harry? 
1248;Firenze  ;Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. 
1249;Firenze  ;You're safe now. Good luck.
1250;Hermione Jean Granger;You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
1251;Harry James Potter;But he's weak. 
1252;Harry James Potter;He's living off the unicorns. 
1253;Harry James Potter;Don't you see? We had it wrong. 
1254;Harry James Potter;Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. 
1255;Harry James Potter;With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. 
1256;Harry James Potter;He'll He'll come back. 
1257;Ronald Bilius Weasley;But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
1258;Harry James Potter; I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
1259;Ronald Bilius Weasley; And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!
1260;Hermione Jean Granger;Hang on a minute.
1261;Hermione Jean Granger;We're forgetting one thing. 
1262;Hermione Jean Granger;Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
1263;Hermione Jean Granger; Dumbledore! 
1264;Hermione Jean Granger;As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. 
1265;Hermione Jean Granger;As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. 
1266;Hermione Jean Granger; I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
1267;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Speak for yourself.
1268;Ronald Bilius Weasley; All right there, Harry?
1269;Harry James Potter;My scar. It keeps burning.
1270;Hermione Jean Granger;It's happened before.
1271;Harry James Potter;Not like this.
1272;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Perhaps you should see the nurse.
1273;Harry James Potter; I think it's a warning.
1274;Harry James Potter; It means dangers coming. Uhh!  
1275;Harry James Potter;Oh. Of course!
1276;Hermione Jean Granger; What is it?
1277;Harry James Potter;Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?
1278;Harry James Potter;I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? 
1279;Harry James Potter;Why didn't I see it before? 
1280;Harry James Potter;Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
1281;Harry James Potter; What did he look like?
1282;Rubeus Hagrid;I don't know. 
1283;Rubeus Hagrid;I never saw his face. 
1284;Rubeus Hagrid;He kept his hood up.
1285;Harry James Potter;The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.
1286;Rubeus Hagrid;Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. 
1287;Rubeus Hagrid;"I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
1288;Harry James Potter; And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
1289;Rubeus Hagrid; Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy!
1290;Rubeus Hagrid; How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? 
1291;Rubeus Hagrid;"But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."
1292;Rubeus Hagrid;" Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
1293;Rubeus Hagrid;  I shouldn't have told you that.
1294;Rubeus Hagrid; Where you going?! Wait!
1295;Harry James Potter; We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
1296;Minerva McGonagall;I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. 
1297;Minerva McGonagall;He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
1298;Harry James Potter;He's gone?! Now? 
1299;Harry James Potter;But this is important! 
1300;Harry James Potter;It's about...the Sorcerer's Stone.
1301;Minerva McGonagall;How do you know?
1302;Harry James Potter;Someone's going to try and steal it.
1303;Minerva McGonagall;I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. 
1304;Minerva McGonagall;Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. 
1305;Harry James Potter;That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. 
1306;Harry James Potter;It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
1307;Hermione Jean Granger; And with Dumbledore gone
1308;Severus Snape; Good afternoon. 
1309;Severus Snape;Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?
1310;Hermione Jean Granger;Uh...we were just...
1311;Severus Snape;You want to be careful.
1312;Severus Snape;People will think you're up to something.
1313;Hermione Jean Granger;Now what do we do?
1314;Harry James Potter;We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
1315;Harry James Potter;Trevor.
1316;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Trevor shh!
1317;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Go, you shouldn't be here!
1318;Neville Longbottom;Neither should you. 
1319;Neville Longbottom;You're sneaking out again, arent you?
1320;Harry James Potter;Now, Neville, listen. We were
1321;Neville Longbottom;No! I won't let you!
1322;Neville Longbottom; You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again!
1323;Neville Longbottom; I-I'll fight you.
1324;Hermione Jean Granger; Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this
1325;Hermione Jean Granger; Petrificus Totalus.
1326;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? 
1327;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Brilliant, but scary.
1328;Harry James Potter; Let's go. Sorry.
1329;Hermione Jean Granger;Sorry.
1330;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's for your own good, you know.
1331;Hermione Jean Granger;Ow! You stood on my foot!
1332;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Sorry.
1333;Hermione Jean Granger;Alohomora.
1334;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Wait a minute...he's.... 
1335;Harry James Potter;Snoring
1336;Harry James Potter;Snape's already been here. 
1337;Harry James Potter;He's put a spell on the harp.
1338;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Uh. It's got horrible breath!
1339;Harry James Potter;We have to move its paw.
1340;Ronald Bilius Weasley;What?!
1341;Harry James Potter;Come on! Okay. Push! 
1342;Harry James Potter;I'll go first. 
1343;Harry James Potter;Don't follow until I give you a sign.
1344;Harry James Potter;If something bad happens, get yourselves out…
1345;Harry James Potter;Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?
1346;Hermione Jean Granger;The harp. It stopped playing.
1347;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ew! Yuck! Ugh. 
1348;Harry James Potter;Jump! Go! 
1349;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ahh! Whoa. 
1350;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
1351;Harry James Potter;Whoa! Oh. Ahh!
1352;Hermione Jean Granger;Stop moving, both of you. 
1353;Hermione Jean Granger;This is Devil's Snare. 
1354;Hermione Jean Granger;You have to relax. 
1355;Hermione Jean Granger;If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
1356;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Kill us faster?! 
1357;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Oh, now I can relax!
1358;Ron and Harry;  Hermione!!
1359;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Now what are we gonna do?!
1360;Hermione Jean Granger;Just relax!
1361;Harry James Potter;Hermione! Where are you?!
1362;Hermione Jean Granger;Do what I say. Trust me. 
1363;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ahh! Harry!
1364;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry!
1365;Hermione Jean Granger;Are you okay?
1366;Harry James Potter;Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
1367;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Help!
1368;Hermione Jean Granger;He's not relaxing, is he?
1369;Harry James Potter;Apparently not.
1370;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Help! Help me!
1371;Hermione Jean Granger;We've got to do something!
1372;Harry James Potter;What?
1373;Hermione Jean Granger;Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. 
1374;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Help!
1375;Hermione Jean Granger;Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! 
1376;Hermione Jean Granger;That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!
1377;Hermione Jean Granger;Lumus Solem!
1378;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ahhh!
1379;Harry James Potter;Ron, are you okay?
1380;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Yeah.
1381;Harry James Potter;Okay.
1382;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
1383;Harry James Potter;Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
1384;Hermione Jean Granger;What is that?
1385;Harry James Potter;I don't know. 
1386;Harry James Potter;Sounds like wings.
1387;Hermione Jean Granger;Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
1388;Harry James Potter;They're not birds, they're keys. 
1389;Harry James Potter;And I'll bet one of them fits that door. 
1390;Hermione Jean Granger;What's this all about?
1391;Harry James Potter;I don't know. Strange.
1392;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Alohomora! 
1393;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Well, it was worth a try.
1394;Hermione Jean Granger;Ugh! What're we going to do? 
1395;Hermione Jean Granger;There must be 1000 keys up there!
1396;Ronald Bilius Weasley;We're looking for a big old fashioned one. 
1397;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Probably rusty like the handle.
1398;Harry James Potter;There! I see it!
1399;Harry James Potter;The one with the broken wing!
1400;Hermione Jean Granger;What's wrong, Harry?
1401;Harry James Potter;It's too simple.
1402;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Oh, go on, Harry! 
1403;Ronald Bilius Weasley;If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! 
1404;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You're the youngest seeker in a century!
1405;Ronald Bilius Weasley;This complicates things a bit!
1406;Harry James Potter;Catch the key!
1407;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Hurry up!
1408;Hermione Jean Granger;I don't like this. 
1409;Hermione Jean Granger;I don't like this at all.
1410;Harry James Potter;Where are we? A graveyard.
1411;Ronald Bilius Weasley;This is no graveyard. 
1412;Ronald Bilius Weasley;It's a chessboard.
1413;Harry James Potter;There's the door.
1414;Hermione Jean Granger;Now what do we do?
1415;Ronald Bilius Weasley; It's obvious, isn't it? 
1416;Ronald Bilius Weasley;We've got to play our way across the room. 
1417;Ronald Bilius Weasley;All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. 
1418;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. 
1419;Ronald Bilius Weasley;As for me, I'll be a knight.
1420;Hermione Jean Granger;What happens now?
1421;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Well, white moves first, and then...we play. 
1422;Hermione Jean Granger;Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
1423;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You there! D-5! 
1424;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
1425;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Castle to E-4!  
1426;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Pawn to C-3!
1427;Harry James Potter;Wait a minute.
1428;Ronald Bilius Weasley;You understand right, Harry. 
1429;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.
1430;Harry James Potter;No, Ron! No!
1431;Hermione Jean Granger; What is it?
1432;Harry James Potter;He's going to sacrifice himself!
1433;Hermione Jean Granger;No, Ron, you can't!
1434;Hermione Jean Granger;There must be another way!
1435;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?
1436;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. 
1437;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Not me, not Hermione, you. 
1438;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Knight...to H-3.
1439;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Check.
1440;Ronald Bilius Weasley;Ahhhh!
1441;Harry James Potter;RON! 
1442;Harry James Potter;NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. 
1443;Harry James Potter;Checkmate. 
1444;Harry James Potter;Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. 
1445;Harry James Potter;Send a message to Dumbledore. 
1446;Harry James Potter;Ron's right...I have to go on.
1447;Hermione Jean Granger;You'll be okay, Harry. 
1448;Hermione Jean Granger;You're a great wizard, you really are.
1449;Harry James Potter;Not as good as you.
1450;Hermione Jean Granger;Me? Books and cleverness? 
1451;Hermione Jean Granger;There are more important things. 
1452;Hermione Jean Granger;Friendship, and bravery. 
1453;Hermione Jean Granger;And Harry, just be careful.
1454;Harry James Potter;You? No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
1455;Quirinus Quirrell;Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? 
1456;Quirinus Quirrell;"Next to him, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"""
1457;Harry James Potter;B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.
1458;Quirinus Quirrell;No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! 
1459;Quirinus Quirrell;And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. 
1460;Quirinus Quirrell;Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.
1461;Harry James Potter;Snape was trying to...save me?
1462;Quirinus Quirrell;I knew you were a danger right from the off. 
1463;Quirinus Quirrell;Especially after Halloween.
1464;Harry James Potter;Th-then you let the troll in.
1465;Quirinus Quirrell;Very good Potter, yes. 
1466;Quirinus Quirrell;Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. 
1467;Quirinus Quirrell;While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. 
1468;Quirinus Quirrell;He, of course, never trusted me again.
1469;Quirinus Quirrell;He rarely left me alone. 
1470;Quirinus Quirrell;But he doesn't understand. 
1471;Quirinus Quirrell;I'm never alone. Never. 
1472;Quirinus Quirrell;Now...what does this mirror do? 
1473;Quirinus Quirrell;I see what I desire. 
1474;Quirinus Quirrell;I see myself holding the stone. 
1475;Quirinus Quirrell;But how do I get it?
1476;Voldemort ;Use the boy
1477;Quirinus Quirrell;Come here, Potter, now!
1478;Quirinus Quirrell;Tell me. What do you see?
1479;Quirinus Quirrell;What is it?! What do you see?!
1480;Harry James Potter;I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. 
1481;Harry James Potter;I've won the house cup.
1482;Voldemort;He lies.
1483;Quirinus Quirrell;Tell the truth! What do you see?!
1484;Voldemort;Let me speak to him.
1485;Quirinus Quirrell;Master, you are not strong enough.
1486;Voldemort;I have strength enough for this. 
1487;Voldemort;Harry Potter. We meet again.
1488;Harry James Potter;Voldemort.
1489;Voldemort  ;Yes. You see what I have become? 
1490;Voldemort  ;See what I must do to survive? 
1491;Voldemort  ;Live off another. A mere parasite. 
1492;Voldemort  ;Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. 
1493;Voldemort  ;But there is something that can. 
1494;Voldemort  ;Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!
1495;Voldemort  ;Stop him! 
1496;Voldemort  ;Don't be a fool! 
1497;Voldemort  ;Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
1498;Harry James Potter;Never!
1499;Voldemort  ;Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. 
1500;Voldemort  ;Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? 
1501;Voldemort  ;Together, we can bring them back. 
1502;Voldemort  ;All I ask for is something in return. 
1503;Voldemort  ;That's it, Harry. 
1504;Voldemort  ;There is no good and evil. 
1505;Voldemort  ;There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. 
1506;Voldemort  ;Together, we'll do extraordinary things. 
1507;Voldemort  ;Just give me the stone! 
1508;Harry James Potter;You liar!
1509;Voldemort;Kill him!
1510;Quirinus Quirrell;Ahh! Ahh! What is this magic?
1511;Voldemort  ;Fool! Get the stone!
1512;Quirinus Quirrell;Ahhhhhhhhhh!
1513;Voldemort  ;Arrrhhhhhh!
1514;Harry James Potter;Ahhhhhhhhh!
1515;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Good afternoon, Harry. 
1516;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
1517;Harry James Potter;Admirers?
1518;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. 
1519;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
1520;Harry James Potter;Ron was here? 
1521;Harry James Potter;Is he all right? 
1522;Harry James Potter;What about Hermione?
1523;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Fine. They're both just fine.
1524;Harry James Potter;But, what happened to the Stone?
1525;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. 
1526;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
1527;Harry James Potter;But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
1528;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. 
1529;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;But yes, he will die.
1530;Harry James Potter;How is it I got the Stone, sir? 
1531;Harry James Potter;One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
1532;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. 
1533;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;That is one of my more brilliant ideas. 
1534;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;And between you and me thats saying something.
1535;Harry James Potter;Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
1536;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. 
1537;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
1538;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;It was because of your mother. 
1539;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. 
1540;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen.
1541;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;It lives in your very skin.
1542;Harry James Potter;What is it?
1543;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Love, Harry, love. 
1544;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. 
1545;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. 
1546;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...
1547;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Mm. Alas. Earwax.
1548;Harry James Potter;All right there, Ron?
1549;Ronald Bilius Weasley;All right? You?
1550;Harry James Potter;All right. Hermione?
1551;Hermione Jean Granger;Never better.
1552;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Another year gone. 
1553;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. 
1554;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. 
1555;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. 
1556;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points
1557;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.
1558;Students;Whoo! Yeah!
1559;Draco Malfoy;Nice one, Mate! 
1560;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. 
1561;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;However, recent events must be taken into account. 
1562;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;And I have a few last minute points to award. 
1563;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. 
1564;Harry James Potter;Good job.
1565;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. 
1566;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. 
1567;Hermione Jean Granger;We're tied with Slytherin!
1568;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. 
1569;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.
1570;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. 
1571;Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore;Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
1572;Rubeus Hagrid;Yes!
1573;Seamus Finnigan;Yeah! We won!!
1574;Rubeus Hagrid;Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. 
1575;Rubeus Hagrid;Train's leaving. 
1576;Rubeus Hagrid;Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
1577;Hermione Jean Granger;Come on, Harry.
1578;Harry James Potter;One minute. 
1579;Rubeus Hagrid;Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? 
1580;Rubeus Hagrid;This is for you.
1581;Harry James Potter;Thanks, Hagrid. 
1582;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh. Go on...on with you. 
1583;Rubeus Hagrid;Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
1584;Harry James Potter;But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
1585;Rubeus Hagrid;I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Off you go.
1586;Hermione Jean Granger;Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
1587;Harry James Potter;I'm not going home. Not really.
